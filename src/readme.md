Task:

Fork this stackblitz and edit as per below. (an account/signin is not needed)
When done, share the url.

You have been asked to update a small marketing website that was never completed properly.

You only need to work on the `page-marketing` component.

The following tasks/bugs have been assigned to you:

- Complete the `getProductsAndPrices` function so that the UI shows the products with their prices.

- The product names are wrapping if the name is too long. Make them show an ellipsis instead on a single line.

- List the footer items in a row instead of a column

- Update the html/css of the products to look better (in whatever way you think would look good)

This task should typically take less than 30min.
We are not looking for perfect, just an indication of how you code and style.
